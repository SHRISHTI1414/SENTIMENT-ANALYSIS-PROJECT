 Sentiment Analysis using Machine Learning

This project focuses on building a machine learning model to classify text data into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments.

 Overview:

The model takes raw text (like tweets or reviews), processes it, and predicts sentiment. Itâ€™s useful for analyzing customer feedback, social media content, or any text-based data to understand user emotions.

Tech Stack:

- Python
- scikit-learn
- pandas, numpy
- matplotlib, seaborn (for visualization)

Features:

- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Text vectorization using TF-IDF
- Trained with models like Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes
- Evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score
- Option to test custom input text
